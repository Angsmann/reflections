When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is particularly useful when working on a project with several people.
Of course, a remote can also serve as a back-up in case your computer crashes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will reduce data traffic, and you can keep a cleaner version locally, which is not always overwritten by data from Git.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is a parallel thread to the main branch, which can be used to test changes.
A clone is simply a copy, no matter if it is within the working directory or from the repository to the working directory.
A clone within GitHub is named fork.
