When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is particularly useful when working on a project with several people.
Of course, a remote can also serve as a back-up in case your computer crashes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This will reduce data traffic, and you can keep a cleaner version locally, which is not always overwritten by data from Git.
